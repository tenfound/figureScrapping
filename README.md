Figure Scrapping:

Objective:
1. Scrap listings from Pre-Owned Section of AmiAmi
2. Compile listings into an excel sheet

find() vs findAll():
find() searches for the first result (automatically sets limit=1)
findAll() searches the entire document

findAll() is of type list, and returns an empty list if nothing is found.
find() returns a string if something is found and None if nothing is found.

Why used used lists instead of growing the dataframe:

& also, df.append() is deprecated. 

Open Price: Figure is likely a prize figure.
